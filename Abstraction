Abstraction : Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details.

Advantages of Data Abstraction:

•	Hides low-level code, simplifying development.
•	Reduces code duplication, improving reusability.
•	Internal changes don’t affect users.
•	Enhances security by exposing only necessary details.
•	Increases readability by reducing complexity.
•	Allows easy addition of new features with minimal impact.
================================
Abstraction in C++:
•	Using Classes:
  o	Groups data members and functions into a single unit.
  o	Uses access specifiers to control visibility.
•	Using Header Files:
  o	Hides implementation details.
  o	Example: pow() function calculates power without exposing the algorithm.

=======================================================

Implementation of Abstraction :

Using Access Specifiers : public , private

Using Abstract Class and Interfernece
