Access Specifiers : 

•	Access Modifiers control access to class members in C++.
•	Also called Access Specifiers, they define access levels for class members.
•	Types of Access Specifiers in C++:
o	Public: Members can be accessed from outside the class.
o	Private: Members can be accessed only within the class.
o	Protected: Members can be accessed within the class and by derived classes.
•	Default Access: If no specifier is given, members are private by default.
