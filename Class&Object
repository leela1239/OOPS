Class:  
•	A class is a user-defined data type.
•	It contains data members (variables) and member functions (methods).
•	These members can be accessed and used by creating an instance (object) of the class.
•	A class acts as a blueprint for creating objects.

Object: 
•	An object is an identifiable entity with characteristics and behavior.
•	It is an instance of a class.

**Note: When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

int main() {
   //Creation of Object way1
    Employee e1;
    e1.name = "Harika";
    e1.id = 101;
    e1.salary = 2500000;
    e1.displayDetails();

    //Creation of Object way2
    Employee e2("Leela",102,239098);
    e2.displayDetails();

     e.displayDetails();  // We created the obj but not assigned //values.So prints default values

}

Output :

Name : Harika
Id : 101
Salary : 2500000
Name : Leela
Id : 102
Salary : 239098
Name : 
Id : 0
Salary : 0
